Much of what I want to say has already been said. Hence, the following account is not a discovery of new paradigms (in the global sense), bur rather, an eclectic collection of personal encounters with different topics and my personal journey to make sense of the chaos and randomness around me.

It has been widely surprising to me the wild range of phenomena that can be formulated, at least conceptually, as control problems, especially in fields that have traditionally nothing to do with control theory. From personal relationships to large scale economic, to everyday encounters with people around one, I cannot help but think to see these events through the lens of control theory. Despite its appeal, control theory is rather a niche field. As such, I hope that my writings here would play a small role in making control theory more popular amongst those originally unfamiliar with it.
