My name is Mohammadreza "Reza" Kazemi. I am a fourth-year student at Florida International University, studying electrical engineering. I am broadly interested in control theory and optimization as a lens to think deeply about the world and to come up with solutions to problems I think are worth solving.

This website is going to serve as mainly a medium for me to share some of my thoughts that would otherwise go unspoken. For me, this will be helpful in organizing my thoughts and documenting them. For you, this will be helpful in gauging, more or less, my philosphy towards research, life, etc.
